## setup process 
### instructions

By now, you should already have Node.js LTS, VS Code, and a compatible operating system installed. This task focuses on setting up Expo Go on your physical device.
Why Expo Go?

Unlike web development, mobile development relies on device emulators to test applications. However, keeping up with the ever-evolving mobile ecosystem (e.g., iPhone 7 → iPhone 16 Pro Max, various Android devices) can be costly in terms of hardware requirements.

Expo Go provides a cost-effective solution by allowing you to test and run your React Native applications directly on your physical device, supporting both iOS and Android seamlessly.
Steps to Install Expo Go

    Visit the official Expo Go homepage: https://expo.dev/go.
    Select the latest SDK version.
    Click on Install for your device:
        Android: Install from the Google Play Store.
        iOS: Install from the Apple App Store.
    Open the Expo Go app on your device.
    Create a new account or log in if you already have one.
